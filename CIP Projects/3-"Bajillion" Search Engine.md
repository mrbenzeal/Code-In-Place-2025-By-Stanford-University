python3 searchengine.py bbcnews -s

Query (empty query to stop): stanford
Results for query 'stanford':
1.  Title: Yahoo celebrates a decade online,  File: bbcnews/066.txt
2.  Title: Google to scan famous libraries,  File: bbcnews/217.txt

Query (empty query to stop): stanford bike
Results for query 'stanford bike':
No results match that query.

Query (empty query to stop): cheap apple products
Results for query 'cheap apple products':
1.  Title: Apple Mac mini gets warm welcome,  File: bbcnews/033.txt

Query (empty query to stop): *user presses "enter" to end program*
