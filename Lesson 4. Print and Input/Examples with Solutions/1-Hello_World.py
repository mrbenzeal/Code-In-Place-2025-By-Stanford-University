Hello, world!
Your first python program looks a lot like Karel!

The "Hello, World!" program is a simple introductory program 
used to demonstrate the basic syntax and functionality of a programming language. 
In Python, the "Hello, World!" program is typically just one line of code 
that prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. 
"""

"""
When we run this code, Python will execute the print() function, 
which takes the string "Hello, World!" as an argument and outputs it to the console. 
This program is often the first program that beginner programmers write 
when learning a new language and is a crucial step towards understanding 
how to write more complex programs. 
It allows beginners to become familiar with basic syntax and the process of executing code.
"""

"""
This main function definition serves as the entry point of the program 
and is responsible for executing the primary functionality 
of printing 'Hello, World!' to the console.

def main():
    # This prints to the console the string: Hello, World!
    print("Hello, World!")


# Run the main function when this file is executed. No need to edit these lines!
