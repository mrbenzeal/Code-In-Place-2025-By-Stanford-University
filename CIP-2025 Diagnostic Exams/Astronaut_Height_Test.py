-------------------------------
Write a console program which asks the user for their height in meters 
and prints whether or not they are the correct height to be a NASA astronaut.
- If their height is greater than 1.6 meters and less than 1.9 meters, print 
  "Correct height to be an astronaut".
- If their height is less than or equal to 1.6 meters, print 
  "Below minimum astronaut height".
- If their height is greater than or equal to 1.9 meters, print 
  "Above maximum astronaut height".
  
You may assume that the user enters a valid input (a non-negative number). 
Each time the program is run, the user is asked for their height only once.

Aside: If you are not the right height to be an astronaut, that is fine! Space is dangerous anyways. 
Chris is not the right height, but found a happy alternative job here on earth ðŸŒ±.
