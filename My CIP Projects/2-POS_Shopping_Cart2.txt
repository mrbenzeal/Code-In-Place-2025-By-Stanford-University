CIP_Section_5 PROJECT - Obinna Ani
-----------------------------------
File: POS_Shopping_Cart.py
---------------------------
This is a Point-of-Sale (POS) Shopping Cart System for a Nigerian Fruit Shop.
- It is a solo-friendly, interactive Python project using the Python graphics.Canvas, time, os and random imports. 
- It simulates a real-world retail checkout experience with product selection 
  via barcode input, a dynamic cart display, stock management, tax. 
- Users can clear carts, see visual updates, and receive real-time total cost calculations. 
- Receipts are exported with customer names, timestamps, and loyalty points. 
- Admin function also include restocking.

NOTE:
-----
This project is subject to more improved functionalities like:
- Click buttons effectiveness for objects on the canvas.
- Improved graphical animations.
- A better decomposited program.
- And more.

VOTE OF THANKS:
---------------
I wish to thank:
- My Section Leader: Anna Q
- My CIP Section Members
- Chris Piech & Mehran Sahami
- And Stanford University's Code in Place 2025 staffs
For making my python learning journey pleasurable.
